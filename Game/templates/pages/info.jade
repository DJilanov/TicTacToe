  p Tic-tac-toe (also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
  p The rules to win are simple:
    ul
      li  If the player has two in a row, they can place a third to get three in a row.
      li  If the opponent has two in a row, the player must play the third themselves to block the opponent.
      li  Create an opportunity where the player has two threats to win (two non-blocked lines of 2).
      li  If there is a configuration where the opponent can fork, the player should block that fork.
      li  A player marks the center. (If it is the first move of the game, playing on a corner gives "O" more opportunities to make a mistake and may therefore be the better choice; however, it makes no difference between perfect players.)
      li  If the opponent is in the corner, the player plays the opposite corner.
      li  The player plays in a corner square.
      li  The player plays in a middle square on any of the 4 sides.
